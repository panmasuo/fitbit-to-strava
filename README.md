# Fitbit activities converter

Fitbit application cannot sync the non-GPS workouts/activities
to Strava application. Developers seems to not work on this issue.

There is some tools online for that but connecting private account seems dangerous.

## Roadmap

- [x] Fitbit API access
- [x] Fitbit authentication
- [ ] Fitbit pull activities
- [ ] Parse multiple time-series data (heart-rate, etc.) into TCX file
- [ ] Strava API access
- [ ] Strava push created TCX file
- [ ] Create user instructions

## Application building

// TODO how to build

## Application running

## Fitbit API access

// TODO instructions on how to access Fitbit tokens and how to authorize

## Strava API access

// TODO instructions on how to access Strava tokens and how to authorize
